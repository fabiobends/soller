- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): Provides type safety, improving code reliability.
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev): Fast, lightweight unit testing framework.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org): Maintains code quality and standards.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io): Formats code for consistent readability.
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky): Manages Git hooks.
- [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org): Enforces structured commit messages.

## Getting Started 🏁

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or above recommended)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fabiobends/soller.git # or using https if you prefer
# followed by
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage 💻

Once the server is running, you can explore key features, like the carousel component, which supports forward and backward navigation. The page also adapts responsively across screen sizes.

## Improvements 🔌

### Short-term Enhancements

- Add a website icon for branding.
- Develop unit tests for the carousel component.
- Implement a custom 404 page.

### Long-term Improvements

- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
- Integrate localization using i18n to support multiple languages.

## Running Tests 🧪

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
```

This runs unit tests using Vitest, verifying functionality of key components.
